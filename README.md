## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Plain CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I worked with the flex properties and max-width to adjust the sizes of the card depending on its screen size. Thus, I worked with media queries and feel more confident using this concept within my code. A new concept I used was replacing a current image/content on a page with the 'content' property which involved a url, similarly to a 'background-image'. This was a fun challenge and I enjoyed working on this card and feel more confident with recreating an image through code without using help/guidance from external sources.  

Content property (within the media queries) - code: 

```css

.img {
        content: url(/images/image-product-desktop.jpg);
        max-width: 50%;
        max-height: 470px;
        border-radius: 8px 0px 0 8px;
    }
```

### Continued development

Regarding my improvements, I need to expand my range of challenges and focus on other fundamental concepts such as css grid instead of flex as it will help me to code more complex projects and responsive websites.
